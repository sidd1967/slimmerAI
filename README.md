# Instructions:
1) Download the code into you local.
2) Open CMD PROMPT in the project folder and run "yarn install" to install all the dependancies.
3) Then run "yarn start" to run the react app. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
4) Navigate to the "api" folder and "yarn install" to install all the dependancies.
To get this  working, run the following two commands:
### pip install spacy
### python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
5) Database Setup:
Install Mysql
Open Command Line and Execute the following queries to set up DB:
### create database feedback;
### use feedback;
### CREATE TABLE myfeedback1 (
### ID int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
### Value varchar(255),
### PRIMARY KEY (ID)
### );
6) In the api/main.py change the username and password to your own:
   app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'username'
   app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = 'password'
7) Create an environment file in the api folder with the name .flaskenv and paste the below code into the file
### FLASK_APP = main.py
### FLASK_ENV = development
   
8) Then run "yart start-api" to run the backend (runs on [http://localhost:5000]
9) Now the Project will run smoothly!! 
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
